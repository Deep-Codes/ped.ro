title: 'Box shadow vs border'

A few weeks ago I did a live demo of [Modulz](https://modulz.app) on a chat with [Max Stoiber](https://twitter.com/mxstbr).

During the demo, I styled a button component including its states. When I styled the `focus` state I spontaneously used a `box-shadow` to apply a "border" around the button, instead of the actual `border` property.

To my surprise, Max noticed it and said:

> Another thing I noticed is that for the focus state, you did that with a shadow instead of a border.

A few days later, I received this tweet from [Rauno Freiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg/status/1252914280363692034):

> [@peduarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte) At the Modulz demo, I remember you and [@mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) talking about using box-shadow for focus styles and that in some way is better than other stuff? I can't find any resources on this. Help a friend out!

Consider this article a response to Rauno's question.
