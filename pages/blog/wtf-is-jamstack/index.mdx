JAMstack is revolutionising the way we think about workflow by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.

Yet, you may be wondering: how? why? wtf is it?

This is why I created [https://jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf)

The goal of this guide is to gather the concept of JAMstack in a straight-forward guide to encourage other developers to adopt the workflow.

## What is JAMstack?

### Meaning

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2968/1*T4kRqCGtoD8PuPjR_ZbPxQ.png)

JAM stands for Javascript, API & Markup.

**Javascript**
Dynamic functionalities are handled by Javascript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.

**APIs**
Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with Javascript. These can be third party services or your custom function.

**Markup
**Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

### Benefits

Here are the main benefits provided by the JAMstack

**Faster performance
**Serve pre-built markup and assets over a CDN

**More secure
**No need to worry about server or database vulnerabilities

**Less expensive
**Hosting of static files are cheap or [even free](https://netlify.com/)

**Better developer experience
**Front end developers can focus on the front end, without being tied to a monolithic architecture. This usually means quicker and more focused development

**Scalability
**If your product suddenly goes viral and has many active users, the CDN seamlessly compensates

### Best Practices

The following tips will help you leverage the best out of the stack.

**Content delivery network
**Since all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalability.

**Atomic deploys
**Each deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a consistent version of the site globally.

**Cache invalidation
**Once your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This means that your new build is live in an instant.

**Everything in version control
**Your codebase lives in Version Control System, such as Git. The main benefits are: change history of every file, collaborators and traceability.

**Automated builds
**Your server is notified when a new build is required, typically via webhooks. Server builds the project, updates the CDNs and the site is live.

### Workflow

Here‚Äôs how an ideal JAMstack workflow would look like

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*iaJIWN-1jhRBTiVfmYYdlA.png)

### Timeline

**2015
**Static sites are becoming popular due to the popularity of certain SSG such as Jekyll.

**2016
**A small group of developers believe that Static sites don‚Äôt have to be static and the term ‚ÄúJAMstack‚Äù comes to life.

**2017
**The modern web revolution starts prioritising the importance of performance, scalability and developer experience. The term JAMstack starts to be adopted by a wider group of developers and the first enterprise JAMstack projects are announced.

**2018
**Tool likes Netlify, Gatsby and Contentful have helped promote the term and the community is rapidly growing. This was also the year of the first JAMstack Conference.

## Getting Started

However you decide to generate your HTML assets is up to you. The three most common approaches are:

### Development

**Hand coding
**Simple and effective method of writing HTML, it‚Äôs ideal for super simple pages.

**Static Site Generators
**Most JAMstack sites are powered by a static site generator. There‚Äôs no enforcement on which SSG you decide to use.

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

[See more SSGs](https://www.staticgen.com/)

**Frontend Framework
**Most frameworks don‚Äôt output static HTML files, however it is possible to do that but it requires more tooling experience and maintenance.

- [React](http://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

### Deployment

Your built site needs to be hosted somewhere. There are great services that provides this for free and with ease.

- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
- [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

[See more deployment services](https://www.thenewdynamic.org/tools/hosting-deployment/)

### Dynamic parts

JAMstack websites don‚Äôt have to be static. There are great services available to help bring some dynamic data to your product.

**Custom functions
**You can also abstract your own functions into reusable APIs. For this you can use [AWS lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/features/) or [Netlify Functions](https://functions.netlify.com/examples/)

**Comments
**Many JAMstack products have dynamic comment sections. These are typically used on blogs

**Forms**
A great way to interact with your audience

**E-Commerce
**Setting up an online store on the JAMstack has never been easier

**Search
**Rely on third party services to integrate a search functionality

[See more static services](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-static-website-services#e-commerce)

### CMS

JAMstack sites can also be controlled via a Content Management System, these are typically known as Headless CMS. Once a change in the CMS is made, a new build of your site will be triggered and then deployed as static assets.

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [Contentful](http://contentful.com/)
- [Headless WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
- [Ghost](https://docs.ghost.org/api/content/)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

[See more CMS services](https://headlesscms.org/)
