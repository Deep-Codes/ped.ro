Another year, another website redesign. But this one's special.

## Tech and UI

I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a foundation. If you haven't heard of it, go check it out, it's pretty cool. I've set it up using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

I'm deploying it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It's great because it's fast and easy to set up.

The UI is powered by [Wallop System](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@peduarte/wallop-system). Wallop System is a design system I built with [Modulz](https://modulz.app). You can read more about this process [over here](/blog/wallop-system-built-with-modulz).

The code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/peduarte/ped.ro) and you're free to take a look, get inspired or fix a bug.

## Blog

I've finally decided to start a blog. Deep down, it's something I've always wanted to do, but never got round to doing it. It was probably a mix of not knowing what to write and being lazy.

But here we are, so let's see how it goes.
