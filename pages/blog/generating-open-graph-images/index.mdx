import microlink from './microlink.png';
const title = 'Designing in code is the future.';
const api = 'https://i.microlink.io/';
const cardUrl = `https://cards.microlink.io/?preset=pedro&title=${title}`;
const image = `${api}${encodeURIComponent(cardUrl)}`;

Inspired by the likes of Chris Biscardi, Joel Hooks, Shawn Wang, and others, I, too, wanted to have dynamically generated social images of my blog posts.

The thought of creating an image generation API was daunting. Cloudinary, Lambdas, Chromium are cool, but I wanted something more straightforward.

It was around this time that Marina introduced me to Microlink and its creator Kiko. Microlink was just about to release their new product, Microlink Cards.

Being one of the alpha testers of Microlink Cards, I decided to take it for a spin and rely on it to generate the social images for me.

Microlink Cards works like this:

1. Pick a template or build your own
2. Define your dynamic queries
3. Add the generated URL to your `meta` tag, providing the right queries

<img src={microlink} />

## Building my template

Instead of using an existing template, I decided to build my own. Templates are built (designed) in JSX, powered by Theme UI. What a good idea! üëè

## Defining my queries

This how you choose what can be customised via query strings passed in to the generated URL.

I created the following queries:

- `heading`: the heading of the card
- `subheading`: the sub-heading of the card
- `title`: the main title of the page you're sharing
- `domain`: the URL of the page you're sharing
- `theme`: a theme object following the [Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec)

## Showing dynamic images

The last step is to take the generated URL and pass in your queries via query strings.

For example, if you want to generate a card with a title of "Designing in code is the future.", you could do:

```jsx
const title = 'Designing in code is the future.';
const api = 'https://i.microlink.io/';
const cardUrl = `https://cards.microlink.io/?preset=pedro&title=${title}`;
const image = `${api}${encodeURIComponent(cardUrl)}`;
```

And then add it as an OpenGraph meta:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="{image}" />
```
