I‚Äôve recently migrated Dona Rita‚Äôs website from Jekyll to Gatsby. I‚Äôd like to share my process with you, as well as a few tips about building a JAMstack site with Gatsby, Netlify and Netlify CMS.

## A bit of background

### What is JAMstack?

_JAM_ stands for **J**avascript **A**PI & **M**arkup. The term JAMstack was popularised by [Mathias Biilmann](https://twitter.com/biilmann?lang=en) (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify) to describe ‚Äúa modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup‚Äù. You can read more about [JAMstack here](https://jamstack.org).

### What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a _blazing-fast_ **Static Site Generator for React** ‚Äî this is important because I wanted to keep the JAMStack I had with Jekyll. Apart from being a SSG, Gatsby is build with modern technologies, it‚Äôs future-proof, it‚Äôs a static PWA out-of-the-box and you can query your data from anywhere via GraphQL üòç

### What/Who is Dona Rita?

Dona Rita is my side business. When I‚Äôm not busy coding, I‚Äôm selling gluten-free Brazilian cheese balls to the British population üòÖ

## My process

The original Dona Rita website was built with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. It was built in an MVP approach, you can [read more about that here](https://medium.com/@OiDonaRita/starting-a-food-business-from-scratch-9baed673657c). Overall, it was working well, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶ Liquid partials are not React components.

When I decided to change my setup from Jekyll to Gatsby, I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how much work/effort that‚Äôd be. I wanted to keep things as simple as possible. In the end I think I was able to find a nice process.

Here‚Äôs how I did it:

### Documentation

I started by reading [Gatsby‚Äôs documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/). They also wrote a neat [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/). Gatsby works differently than Jekyll, so it‚Äôs worth giving these a read first.

### Choosing a Gatsby starter

I used the [\*gatsby-starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world)\*. This is probably the simplest starter you can use. I chose this because I wanted to start with bare minimum configuration. I find it easier to learn a framework this way.

### Creating a Gatsby Layout

Anything you add to a [Layout Component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/#layout-components) will be shared amongst all other pages. This is particularly useful for global components, such as Navigation or Footer.

You can see the source code for my [layout here](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/layouts/index.js).

### Stateless pages

I started by creating stateless [Page Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/#page-components). The point here was to start getting a feel for how Gatsby creates pages, without having to worry about GraphQL.

I left stateful pages (pages that depend on data) and dynamic pages (pages that will be generated from Markdown files) for later.

The first page I added was the [Ingredients](https://www.donarita.co.uk/ingredients/) page, you can see the [source code here](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/pages/ingredients.js).

### **Adding styles**

The original Dona Rita website was styled with global CSS, written in Sass. To keep things moving, I decided to keep this approach instead of converting my styles to [Styled Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/styled-components/).

In order for Gatsby to process Sass files, you need install [\*gatsby-plugin-sass](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/) \*(drop-in support, works like a charm).

Because I needed to inject the styles globally, I imported them in my Layout file.

### Stateful pages

By now I had a few static pages rendered and styled correctly. I was becoming more comfortable with Gatsby and I was ready to create my first stateful page.

I decided to start with the [Buy Page](https://donarita.co.uk/buy). For this page I needed to get access to a list of allowed postcodes which I will be passed down to my [Product Component](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/components/Product/Product.js#L26) to determine whether we can deliver there or not.

I created a file called [postcodes.json](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/data/postcodes.json) in a src/data/ directory and installed the following dependencies: [\*gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/)* and [*gatsby-transformer-json](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-json/).\*

[Here‚Äôs source code](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/data/postcodes.json) for the JSON file and [here‚Äôs the source code](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/pages/buy.js#L35-L41) for the Buy page.

```json
// postcodes.json
[
  {
    "allowed": ["E1", "E11", "E12", "E14"]
  }
]
```

```js
// buy.js
export const pageQuery = query`
	query BuyPageQuery {
		allPostcodesJson {
			edges {
				node {
					allowed
				}
			}
		}
	}
`;
```

**#protip:** Gatsby has a [really nice tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-four/) to help understand its data layer. Definitely worth a read.

### Components abstraction

Once most of my stateless and stateful pages were created, I took a bit of time to refactor some parts of the code. I created a src/components/ folder and added a few components to help improve maintainability of the project.

[Here‚Äôs a list](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/tree/master/src/components) of the components I abstracted.

## Moving from GH Pages to Netlify

I was happy with Github Pages, but [Netlify](https://netlify.com) is so good, so fast, so easy to use that it‚Äôs hard to say no‚Ä¶ it offers instant rollbacks, one-click SSL, prerendering, deploy previews, and many more awesome features.

When a new Pull Request is created, Netlify automatically generates a [Deploy Preview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/). This feature is pure gold. It allows you and other members of the team to see how the changes affect the project.

When the PR gets merged to the master branch, then Netlify triggers the production deployment. I‚Äôve turned on [Slack Notification](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/18/shiny-slack-notifications-from-netlify/), so everyone in the team knows when a new production deployment has happened üéâ

## Adding Netlify CMS

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is an open source content management system for Git workflows. I decided to give it a try as it seemed surprisingly simple.

The way I set it up was by authenticating Netlify CMS with Github via [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/authentication-backends/). As with anything Netlify related, it was only a couple of clicks.

I used Netlify CMS to manage my ‚ÄúShops‚Äù data. The way I am managing this data is by having one Markdown file per Shop. You can see the source for the Shops page [here](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/src/pages/shops/index.js).

I also created a [configuration](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/) file. Through this file I was able to create collections and to define which fields can be modified via the CMS.

You can see the source for Netlify config [here](https://github.com/peduarte/dona-rita-website/blob/master/static/admin/config.yml).

```yaml
# config.yml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master

publish_mode: editorial_workflow

media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img

collections:
  - name: 'shops'
    label: 'Shop'
    folder: 'src/pages/shops'
    create: true
    slug: '{{name}}' # this will be filename
    fields:
      - { label: 'Name', name: 'name', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Area', name: 'area', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Address', name: 'address', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Postcode', name: 'postcode', widget: 'string' }
      - { label: 'Outcode', name: 'outcode', widget: 'string' }
```

If you‚Äôre interested in adding a CMS to your static site, I‚Äôd definitely recommend using Netlify CMS. You can read [the docs here](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs).

## Wrapping up

I‚Äôm really happy with these changes. Gatsby, Netlify and Netlify CMS are all game changers. And when used together, they work in complete harmony.

If you‚Äôre as interested in JAMstack as I do, I‚Äôd highly recommend using these tools.

If you have any advice on how anything here can be improved, please feel free to let me know üôå

The initial Jekyll-to-Gatsby migration took me about 6 hours (including having to learn Gatsby and GraphQL).
