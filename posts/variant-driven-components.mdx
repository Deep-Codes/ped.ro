Variants are an excellent way to express how a component could look. It allows us to separate our design concerns into isolated rules.

Variants can be immutable, responsive, and composed. This enables a great deal of flexibility and power when building UIs.

In this article, I'll demonstrate how you can build variant-driven components using [Stitches]().

---

## Context

Since joining [Modulz](), almost three years ago, I've been exploring the idea of variant-driven components. The Modulz editor was designed with variants in mind, and so was the production-ready code output.

At the time, we were creating faux variants on top of existing styling solutions. However the result wasn't ideal. We needed an interoperable solution, so both the designers and developers could work on the same source of truth.

### Stitches

[Stitches]() is a styling solution focusing on component architecture and developer experience.

It introduces a first-class variant API, enabling design system authors to express their intent better. It's fully typed, catching potential mistakes and improving the scalability of design systems. It's lightweight, coming in at less than 5kb. And finally, it's a breeze to get up and running with it.

### This article

To highlight how variants can be created and consumed, I'm going to use a generic `Box` component.

If you'd like to follow along, make sure you've installed Stitches:

```bash
# yarn
yarn add @stitches/react

# npm
npm i @stitches/react
```

## Creating a component

To create the `Box` component, first, import the `styled` function from Stitches:

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
```

Then use it to create a component:

```jsx line=3-7
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
  backgroundColor: 'pink',
});
```

Finally, render it just like you would any React component:

{

<Preview>
  <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$pink' }} />
</Preview>
}

```jsx line=5
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {…});

const App = () => <Box />
```

This is how you create and style components with Stitches. To learn more about, go have a look at the [documentation site]().

## Creating a variant

Stitches offers a first-class API for creating variants. Becuase of this, they're automatically typed.

Let's add a `color` variant to the `Box`.

```jsx line=8-14
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
  backgroundColor: 'pink',

  variants: {
    color: {
      turquoise: {
        backgroundColor: 'turquoise',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

We can render it at that specific variant, by passig it as a prop.

{

<Preview>
  <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$turq' }} />
</Preview>
}

```jsx line=5
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {…});

const App = () => <Box __color__="turquoise" />
```

Nice. We can go further and add a `shape` variant:

```jsx line=9-22

import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
  backgroundColor: 'pink',

  variants: {
    color: {…},
    shape: {
      round: {
        borderRadius: '100%'
      }
    }
  },
});
```

Now, we can apply these variants as props:

{

<Preview>
  <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$turq', borderRadius: '100%' }} />
</Preview>
}

```jsx line=5
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {…});

const App = () => <Box __color__="turquoise" __shape__="round" />
```

## Separating concerns

Let's take a step back and review our code so far.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
  backgroundColor: 'pink',

  variants: {
    color: {
      turquoise: {
        backgroundColor: 'turquoise',
      },
    },
    shape: {
      round: {
        borderRadius: '100%',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Notice how currently there are some base styles and some variant styles. This creates some _implicit_ variants. Let me explain...

To make it turquoise you must _explicitly_ pass it as a `color` prop. But the same isn't true for pink, because there's no such variant.

For example, imagine we want to apply the `color` variant based based on a condition.

```jsx
const App = ({ active }) => <Box color={active ? 'turquoise' : undefined} />;
```

This would work, but we can do better—by being explicit:

```jsx
const App = ({ active }) => <Box color={active ? 'turquoise' : 'pink'} />;
```

We can achieve this by separating stylistic concerns into variants.

```diff
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
- backgroundColor: 'pink',

  variants: {
    color: {
+     pink: {
+       backgroundColor: 'pink',
+     },
      turquoise: {
        backgroundColor: 'turquoise',
      },
    },
    shape: {
+     square: {
+       borderRadius: 0
+     },
      round: {
        borderRadius: '100%',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Variant composition

Now that we have a few variants, we can mix and match (compose) them. This is when things start to get interesting!

{

<Preview>
  <Box css={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', alignItems: 'center', gap: '$4' }}>
    <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$pink' }} />
    <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$turq' }} />
    <Box
      css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$pink', borderRadius: '100%' }}
    />
    <Box
      css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$turq', borderRadius: '100%' }}
    />
  </Box>
</Preview>
}

```jsx
<Box color="pink" />
<Box color="turquoise"  />
<Box color="pink" shape="round" />
<Box color="turquoise" shape="round" />
```

## Defining a default variant

When you separate your stylistic concerns into variants you need to explicitly tell your component which variant to use.

```html
<Box color="pink" shape="square" />
```

But you can define default variants, essentially mimicking the base styles behaviour—without compromises.

```jsx line=18-21
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',

  variants: {
    color: {
      pink: {…},
      turquoise: {…}
    },
    shape: {
      square: {…},
      round: {…},
    },
  },

  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'pink',
    shape: 'square'
  }
});
```

Then, use it

{

<Preview>
  <Box css={{ width: '100px', height: '100px', backgroundColor: '$pink' }} />
</Preview>
}

```html
<Box />
```

## Responsive styles

Currently our `Box` is 100px. But let's say we'd like to make it responsive, by increasing its size to 200px when the viewport is wider than 480px.

A common approach to this is adding media queries in the styles:

```jsx line=4-10
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',

  '@media (min-width: 480px)': {
    width: '200px',
    height: '200px',
  },

  variants: {…},

  defaultVariants: {…}
});
```

This fulfils our initial requirement. The box gets bigger when it needs to.

But hang on. What if now we'd like to be able to render the `Box` at 200px on mobile? And what if it needs to be 100px on larger viewports?

You see where this is heading, right?

We can do better. With immutable variants.

## Immutable variants

The idea behind immutable variants is simple. Its styles should be the same across all media queries.

## Compound variants
