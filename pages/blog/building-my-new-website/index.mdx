I'd like to talk about the reasons behind this choice and use this opportunity to showcase the entire process, from prototyping to design system to dynamic functionalities.

## Prototyping

I used [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.com) as a way to get up and running fast. To build the UI without having to worry about creating custom components and custom styling choice, I used our own `Primitives` library. That was super helpful because every primitive available supports an `sx` prop.

```jsx
<Box sx={{ bg: 'red' }}>
  <Text sx={{ fontSize: 1, color: 'white' }}>Hello, world</Text>
</Box>
```
